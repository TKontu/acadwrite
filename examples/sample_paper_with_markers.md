## How to Use This Example

1. **Save this file** as `sample_paper.md`

2. **Expand all markers**:
   ```bash
   acadwrite expand sample_paper.md -c your_collection_name
   ```

3. **Preview first** (dry run):
   ```bash
   acadwrite expand sample_paper.md -c your_collection_name --dry-run
   ```

4. **Expand without backup**:
   ```bash
   acadwrite expand sample_paper.md -c your_collection_name --no-backup
   ```

5. **Expand to new file**:
   ```bash
   acadwrite expand sample_paper.md -c your_collection_name -o final_paper.md
   ```

## Expected Result

After expansion, you'll have:
- Each marker replaced with cited, academic content
- Inline citations in the format (Author, Year, p.X)
- Content tailored to the topic hints you provided
- Word counts roughly matching the max_words parameters
- A complete draft ready for editing and refinement

## Customization

Try modifying the markers:
- Change topic focus
- Adjust max_words limits
- Switch operations (expand, evidence, citations, clarity, contradict)
- Add your own sections with markers

## Next Steps

1. Review generated content
2. Edit for your specific needs
3. Add your own insights and analysis
4. Extract citations: `acadwrite citations extract final_paper.md --format bibtex -o refs.bib`
5. Check citations: `acadwrite citations check final_paper.md --strict`
